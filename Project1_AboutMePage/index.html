    <hr>
    <p class="container">My name is Salvador Muro. I am a undergraduate student attending <a href="https://www.csusb.edu/">CSUSB</a> pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Systems. I became interested in this field when I attended a class at Norco College surrounding game development. This class introduced me to game programming and C# became the first coding language I learned. As I learned more about game development and the roles within this field, I became more geared towards game design, where I can convey my creativity the most. As I followed this career path, my focus is now aimed towards learning new subjects related to game development which led to me learning C++, HTML, CSS. As I participated in personal and group projects in which revolved around a variety of game genres, I began to learn how to utilize Unity engine accordingly and how to efficiently work with fellow peers. <br><br>
    Since I was a student at Norco College, I searched for four year universities that offered programs related to game development which was when I found out about CSUSB's Computer Systems program. As of now, I have been completing certificates in several areas such as GenAI and have been working on personal projects to further enhance my skills.
    <br><br>
    Even though my main interest is in game development, I also have interests in App Development and Artificial Intelligence.
    As I earn my degree, I hope in reaching my goal in becoming a game developer or get involved in developing unique games/applications.
